HOW TO USE: Open the project in VS Code, and click "Debug and Run." After the API opens in a browser window, go into the debug console and copy the "http" URL instead of the "https" URL. You'll find both URLs in the section with mostly white letters. Paste the URL into an API Platform such as Postman, and then add "/ReverseIt/reverse/{number}" to the end of it, replacing {number} with the number you want to reverse. Make sure to put in at least two digits when you do so, as one digit by itself can't be put in reverse order.
